# Lesson Example

## Overview

This example has a `Lesson` and `Challenge`. A `lesson` has many `challenges` and a `challenge` belongs to a `lesson`. Our goal is practice using `scope`, `module`, `as`, and nested resources.

## To Do
- Use `scope`, `module`, `as`, and/or `namespace` to generate routes that include a `admin` prefix. For example, I want to visit your application, and type `/admin/lessons` into the url and see something different than if I typed `/lessons`. Be sure you create your controllers and views so you can test that this is working properly (there's some seed data that exists for you).
- Use nested resources to build out the `challenges` functionality. When I go to `/lessons/4/challenges`, I should see a list of `challenges` that are associated with `lesson` 4. 

## Think your done?
Done is an interesting concept in software development. What does "done" mean to you? What else can you build within the scope of this application that builds on what you've learned today or in the past few weeks?
